# Research and Education WG Draft Charter

## 1. Working Group Name

Research and Education Working Group (edu)

## 2. Purpose

The purpose of this working group is to develop a set of profiles for the
OpenID Connect specifications to ease the adoption of OpenID Connect in
the research and education (R&E) sector. The profiles will take into
account existing practices of federated identity management in the R&E
sector, current international standards to represent users that belong
to R&E institutions, as well as the existing international trust fabric
based on R&E identity federations.

## 3. Scope

* Develop a profile for OpenID Connect with specific requirements for
security, trust and interoperability in the R&E sector.
* Develop a profile for the use of a specific set of claims related to
the R&E sector.
* Develop a profile for extending OpenID Connect entity's metadata to
support policy frameworks used in the R&E sector.

## 4. Proposed Specifications

 * edu profile for OpenID Connect.
 * edu claims for OpenID Connect.
 * entity metadata extension for OpenID Connect.
 
## 5. Anticipated audience or users

The anticipated audience for the documents produced by this Working Group
includes developers, deployers, and designers of online services and
network agents and devices that can act on behalf of users and
organisations in the R&E sector.

The group also anticipates gathering input from identity specialists from
R&E organizations in order to respond to their requirements.

## 6. Language

Work will be conducted in English.

## 7. Method of work

E-mail discussions on the working group mailing list, regular working
group conference calls, and opportunistic face-to-face meetings when a
significant number of active members are co-located. 

## 8. Basis for determining when the work is completed

The work will be considered complete once it is apparent that maximal
consensus on the drafts has been achieved, consistent with the purpose
and scope of the charter, interoperability with at least two independently
developed implementations of software based on the profiles has been
demonstrated, and the bodies of international organizations relevant in
R&E involved in the development have been given the opportunity to
consistently express feedback and comments in series of iterations of the
drafts (not less than three).
